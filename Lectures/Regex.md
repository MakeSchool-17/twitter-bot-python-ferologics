**PATERN MATCHING**

*exact vs. inexact match*

- exact   : describe a literal string to match on
- inexact : descrive a pattern to match on

EXAMPLE - find quotes...

regex grouping - "\$(\d+\.?\d*)" the () specifies what you actually
                                want to pull out, the \$ is just a match

watch out for - special characters, flags
